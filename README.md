# Image-classification-with-CNN-your-own-image-
classify your own image with CNN ,, example in this case classification is between slightly cross assembled mechanical unit vs straightly assembled mechanical unit 
imagine you want to identify the wrongly assembled mechanical unit in your process by classifying the image to ok or nok 
All the input you need to feed in is images of the feature you want to classify with different background and angles of view 
Our neural network will be able to identify the right one vs the other easily due to its layered algorithm 
Run the files in below order
1. Create _photo_dataset.ipynb
2. CNN_neuron_init.ipynb
3. Anaalyse_model.ipynb
4. Optimize_model.ipynb
5. Use_trained_model.ipynb(this file you will predict your result)

Chnage the file path in create_photo+dataset.ipynb to your folder containing the image input file 

input files for each image classification should be atleast 600images in numbers to get the neurons predict properly
